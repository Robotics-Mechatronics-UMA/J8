# Robotics Mechatronics Project

## Overview
This project is designed for advanced robotic control and simulation using ROS2. It integrates multiple packages to manage robot simulations, sensor data processing, and real-time control. The packages are added as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## Features
- **Simulation Models**: Gazebo simulation models for various robot configurations.
- **Sensor Integration**: Drivers for different sensors including Fixposition and Ublox.
- **Control Algorithms**: Advanced control algorithms for path management and mission control.
- **User Interface**: GUI for easy interaction and control of the robots.
- **Security Checks**: Modules to ensure safe and secure operation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **ROS2**: Make sure ROS2 is installed on your system. Follow the [ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html).
- **Dependencies**: Install additional dependencies required for the packages.

### Building the Workspace
```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Robotics-Mechatronics-UMA/J8.git

# Install dependencies
./install.sh

# Build the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## Docker Deployment

Using Docker is the recommended way to run the stack without manually installing ROS2, LCM, or any other dependency on the host.

Two Dockerfiles are provided:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `dockerfile` | **VPN mode** — waits for the ZeroTier interface (`ztpp6e24bc`) and auto-configures CycloneDDS over it. |
| `dockerfile.local` | **Local network mode** — no VPN, CycloneDDS uses autodetected interfaces. Suitable for same-LAN deployment. |

### Build

```sh
# VPN image
docker build -f dockerfile -t argosj8_vpn .

# Local-network image
docker build -f dockerfile.local -t argosj8_local .
```

### Run (local network, with GUI)

```sh
xhost -local:root
```

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  --network host \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -e QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
  argosj8_local:latest
```

> `--network host` is recommended so that ROS2 multicast discovery works without extra configuration.

### Run (VPN mode)

The container requires the ZeroTier interface to be available on the host:

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  --network host \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -e QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
  argosj8_vpn:latest
```

## Usage

Launch and configuraiton to run all the nodes can be found in a [dedicated package](https://github.com/Robotics-Mechatronics-UMA/argj801_setup).

### Quick start (local)

Source the workspace:

```sh
source install/setup.bash
```

#### Bringup without control center / without LCM

This is the most robust way to start the stack when you don't have the external control center sending LCM heartbeats.

```sh
ros2 launch argj801_setup J8_launch.py \
  robot:=true \
  platform_mode:=2 \
  sensors_source:=lcm_sensors \
  enable_mpc:=false
```

Notes:

- `platform_mode:=2` forces `argj801_ctrl_platform_node` to run in Gazebo mode (no LCM). Values: `0` Arduino, `1` LCM, `2` Gazebo.
- `sensors_source` is a required CLI argument for `ARGJ801_sensors_node`. Valid values are `lcm_sensors` and `camera`.
- `enable_mpc:=true` requires Python dependency `cvxpy`.

#### Bringup with control center (LCM)

If you want the rover to accept commands from the control center via LCM multicast:

```sh
ros2 launch argj801_setup J8_launch.py robot:=true platform_mode:=1
```

On the rover host, you must have a multicast route for `224.0.0.0/4` on the NIC connected to the rover network:

```sh
sudo ./scripts/ensure_multicast_route.sh <iface>
```

Verify that packets arrive:

```sh
sudo tcpdump -ni <iface> 'udp and (port 5004 or port 5006)'
```

If `tcpdump` shows **0 packets**, the issue is usually upstream (no sender, wrong network path, IGMP snooping/switch rules).

# REMOTE CONECTION TO THE CONTROL CENTER

To communicate with the contol center or other robots, the Husarnet VPN is used
## Creating a network.  
  
First register and create a network in Husrnet, or use an existing one:  

## Installing Husarnet VPN client
Execute this command on each physical device you need to connect.

```
curl -s https://install.husarnet.com/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Creating a Husarnet group
Add your physical devices to the same Husarnet group, by executing following commands on each of them:

```
husarnet join <your-join-code> <device-hostname>

```

![join vpn](https://husarnet.com/assets/images/docs-joincode-1eba003ca62a1732ba30b4642bc5fe47.png)

### Configuration of the DDS:  
  
Husarnet-DDS is a utility that automates the generation of DDS XML configuration files for Husarnet.

First, install Husarnet-DDS on each device in your Husarnet group (eg. on your robot and your laptop) from GitHub releases (available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows), eg. on Ubuntu:

```
RELEASE="v1.3.5"
ARCH="amd64"

sudo curl -L https://github.com/husarnet/husarnet-dds/releases/download/$RELEASE/husarnet-dds-linux-$ARCH -o /usr/local/bin/husarnet-dds
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/husarnet-dds
```

Next, choose the DDS implementation that you want to use with your ROS 2 application. Husarnet-DDS supports both Fast DDS and Cyclone DDS.

Set up the required environment variables based on your chosen DDS implementation on each device in your ROS 2 network (eg. on your robot and your laptop), or add it to the .bashrc.

```
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=/var/tmp/husarnet-fastdds-simple.xml
husarnet-dds singleshot
```
Check that the remote center and the robot are online in the specific network in the [Husarnet Dashboard](https://app.husarnet.com/):
